		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>
		<h3>“Women’s Pockets are Inferior” by The Pudding<h3>

		<!-- Paragraph tag -->
		<p>This data journalism project aims to inform the audience that the fashion industry oppresses women by making their pockets way smaller than men’s. For modern-day women, pockets represent not only private space but also equality. Indeed, women should have functional pockets to make their lives more convenient.</p>
		
		<!-- A href tag -->
		<p> The data source from this project comes from <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/pockets"> The Pudding's GitHub database</a>. The Github folder contains four metadata pieces about pants measurements, such as statistics and computer-generated diagrams. When heading to the bottom section of the article, there is a straightforward clarification on the mathematical model used to measure the differences between pants for women and men.</p>
		
        <!-- Paragraph tag -->
		<p> Throughout the article, there are many effective dataviz elements, similar to what we saw in the racial segregation in Twin Cities reading from last week. First, there is a “scroll-down” contrast. By scrolling down, the reader will see that women’s pockets are highlighted in red, whereas men’s are in yellow. The consistent color grading allows the readers to comprehend the notes provided by the research team more easily. In my opinion, I thought this dataviz element was super engaging, and it made me learn that women’s pockets are generally 48% shorter and 6.5% narrow than men’s. This sad reality can make us, as readers, reflect on how women are still a minority. Second, there is an interactive tool where users can click on a phone brand and see if it fits within women’s and men’s pockets. I thought this one was pretty cool. The visualizations are strong, accompanied by detailed explanations of what percentage a phone can get into a woman’s pocket. Third, like the graphic in the racial segregation article, I wouldn’t say I liked when the research team put too many pictures and information on one page. I knew I should select each tab to draw the comparison, but something about it just irked me. Last, there is a highlighted section about the average, biggest, and smallest of women’s and men’s jeans (front and back pockets). I love this dataviz element because it shows numbers and direct findings.</p>

		<!-- Paragraph tag -->
		<p> Regarding the visceral aspect of the project, I agree that the article does not leave an impression as an intellectual bragging about knowing the feminist field. I see more about how the authors analyze the data and models to draw valid conclusions about why they think women’s rights are being infringed. Also, I appreciate including the historical context: how women’s fashion changed in the 18th century from practical to decorative. By including this historical piece, readers will better understand the authors’ deep, internal feelings toward the subject matter of gender inequality.</p>

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<!-- Iframe tag -->
		<iframe title="FINDING: During the last decade, the United States’ active duty military personnel in China has only 4% population of that of the United Kingdom." aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-eL4OK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eL4OK/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="804"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>


		<h4>Here are some further clarification, if needed.</h4>


	<!-- Paragraph tag -->
		<p>*CHART TYPE: The grouped bar chart extends the standard bar chart from looking at numeric values across one categorical variable to two. In this case, the variables are the total number of U.S. troops in China and the United States in the last decade.</p>	

    <!-- Paragraph tag -->
		<p>**LIMITATION: The decision of choosing only China and the United Kingdom is somewhat biased. However, with how large the data set is, focusing on two specific cases can be forgiven. It is rather to make a precise and accurate analysis than a world map where all CCMD regions are highlighted (but not helpful to formulate a potential finding).</p>
